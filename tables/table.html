    <td><img src="madagascardaygecko.JPEG" alt="picture of green gecko with red spots"></td>
    <td><center>Madagascar Day Gecko</center></td>
    <td><center>Phelsuma Grandis</center></td>
    <td><center>8-12 inches</center></td>
    <td><center>8-10 years</center></td>
    <td><center>$50-500</center></td>
    <td><center> Most commonly owned amongst Day Geckos. Green body with red spots or stripes.<br>
        Very intelligent and curious/ skittish geckos. Price depends on morph or if wild <br>caught. 
         Regular ones are more green with less red spots. High red morphs are more <br>expensive 
         and have more red. Blue blood morphs are the most expensive with blue on <br>
         the bellies and towards the head. Most generally don't like being <br>
         handled/ should not be handled as they can "drop" skin off like dropping tails.<br>
         Different from skin shed. They can literally let go of their skin. <br>
         I call them zombie lizards. The more intelligent/curious ones will <br>
         make an exception and let you get close or touch/ handle them. <br>
        Bioactive enclosure required.</center></td>

    <td><center>$100-200</center></td>
    <td><center>Juveniles/ babies have this green to blue gradient with brown/grey stripes covering <br>
         their body. Unfortunately their color fades as they get older and they turn kinda grey with <br>
         very faded colors which is why they don't get very pricey. Similar personality to regular day geckos.<br>

    <td><center>2.5-4 inches</center></td>
    <td><center>8-10 years</center></td>
    <td><center>$300-500</center></td>
    <td><center>Endagered species in the wild. Can only obtain from captive bred breeders. Can be hard<br>
    to come by but are becoming more obtainable. Females are not blue more greenish/brown <br>
    and are cheaper than the males. Much more sensitive to environment so their humidity and <br>
    temperature settings must be precise. Are not as forgiving as other species on this list <br>
    if their requirements for their environment are not met. Advanced geckos and should not be <br>
    handled. Personality wise very skittish but some individuals can be curious and let you get close.<br>
Bioactive enclosure required. </center></td>

    <td><center>$300</center></td>
    <td><center>Actually a color morph of the Gold Dust Day Gecko. Not it's own species. Very very hard<br>
    to come by as this specific morph is really hard to breed and takes a long time to achieve.<br>
    Similar personality as well to regular day geckos. Biaoctive required.</center></td>

    <td><Center>Also hard to come by in the pet trade. Like the electric blue are also very sensitive<br>
    to their environment and requirements need to be met. Consume pinhead crickets and fruit flies. Bioactive enclosure required.</Center></td>

    <td><center>10-12 years</center></td>
    <td><center>$100-1000+</center></td>
    <td><center>Also known as spawn of satan. Are known for their very fiery/ angry personalities<br>
    and viewed as difficult to tame. This one like all geckos above require bioactive eclosures.<br>
    This one is the most adaptable to it's environment and there's room for "human error" in<br>
     their requirements. They won't perish as easily if you mess up. <br>
    Most vocal of all the species in this list. "Croak" when angry or get defensive.</center></td>

    <td><center>$200-1000+</center></td>
    <td><center>The most easy animal to care for on this list. And lives the longest. Literally a <br>
    a potato with legs. Also have a wide variety diet and can pretty much eat your table scraps.<br>
    Very friendly and can be easily handled without having to train the animal to be used to it.</center></td>

    <td><center>14-20 inches</center></td>
    <td><center>5-8 years</center></td>
    <td><center>$300-800</center></td>
    <td><center>In general most chameleons are fragile and get stressed easily. Not the most <br>
    recommended to handle. Some make exceptions. They don't require bioactive but need vertical space<br>
    and branches to climb. Screen cages best as they need ventilation. Can come in a variety of colors<br>
    How colorful an individual is also determines its price. </center></td>

    <td><center>3 ft</center></td>
    <td><center>10-15 years</center></td>
    <td><center>$800-2000</center></td>
    <td><center>Most advanced species on this list. Monitor lizards in general are for more experienced <br>
    keepers. They're incredibly intelligent and personable, however similar to crocodilians and other<br>
    monitors and even iguanas they're difficult to break down and really stick to their instincts. <br>
    For example most captive bred bearded dragons you can pick up and kinda play with them <br>
    whenever. They're not going to care or do anything. These guys even tamed and with routine <br>
    can just switch back to their old ways and snap in an instant. Even if captive bred,<br>
    you have to really pay attention to their signals or you can lose a finger.<br> </center></td>
