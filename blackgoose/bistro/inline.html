    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature you want the food
    to be cooked to. In his book,<i> Cooking for Geeks</i>,
    Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

    <p><small>Warning: <i>Sous vide </i>cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
